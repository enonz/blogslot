1. make sure you have installed newest ruby and the rails in your computer
2. make sure to have postgresql installed too, but, if you don't you can configure what kind of database you use in config/database.yml
3. clone this project to your local directory
4. write in your terminal or console , something like:
  $rake db:migrate
  $rake db:seed
  $rails s
5. now, you can open the application in your browser.
